use:

1. @coinbase/cdp-core - Core business logic to access the embedded wallet APIs
1. @coinbase/cdp-hooks - React hooks for state management of end users with embedded wallets
1. @coinbase/cdp-react - Off-the-shelf UI components for embedded wallets 
1. @coinbase/cdp-wagmi - Embedded wallet connector for Wagmi
1. @coinbase/create-cdp-app - A CLI for creating a starter app using the packages above
